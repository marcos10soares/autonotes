1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,299
What's going on engineers. The
question today is what is Linux

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:06,599
used for. Let's talk about that,
let's also talk about where you

3
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:09,749
might use it and then also some
common and uncommon places that

4
00:00:09,749 --> 00:00:12,419
you might find Linux, and this
is one of your first Linux

5
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:15,179
videos you're not even sure what
it is you could pick up Linux as

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,469
similar to Windows or Mac OS,
with a few key differences, and

7
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:22,109
the big differences are that
Linux is a free and open

8
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,429
platform and this free as in
cost, but also in freedom, it's

9
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:30,659
also a lot smaller, and it's
also very flexible. And it's

10
00:00:30,659 --> 00:00:33,629
that flexibility is why it's
used for so many things. In

11
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:35,939
fact, there's a lot of people
that use Linux every day without

12
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:38,639
even realizing it, and we'll
talk about that in a second. So

13
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:41,159
let's get started. Before we get
started I have several things

14
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:44,819
and I've ordered them roughly in
terms of how dominant Linux is

15
00:00:44,849 --> 00:00:47,939
in a given area, which brings us
to the first thing Linux is used

16
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:51,119
for and that's super computing,
and this area is an area where

17
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,989
Linux is the undisputed grand
champion in terms of market

18
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,279
share in 2020, at least 99% of
all supercomputers are running

19
00:00:59,279 --> 00:01:02,489
Linux. The purpose number one
spot was held by Unix and really

20
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,429
there was no other platform that
ever even came close to either

21
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:09,359
Unix or Linux, nowadays came out
in 1991 but it took about eight

22
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,119
years for it to mature before it
started being used in

23
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,119
supercomputing. But once I got a
foothold in that was there for

24
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,979
UNIX, from 2000 to 2010 It went
from 5% market share to 90%

25
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,739
market share. That's a pure
reason why Linux is adoption

26
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:25,439
supercomputing was both broad
and rapid but it comes down to

27
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,169
one thing and that was the
openness of the platform, being

28
00:01:28,169 --> 00:01:30,419
able to create a customized
distribution just for

29
00:01:30,419 --> 00:01:33,389
supercomputing is hugely
beneficial, and that's just

30
00:01:33,389 --> 00:01:36,299
something that Unix can't do the
next year it seems says mobile

31
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,989
devices, the largest most widely
deployed mobile platform on

32
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:42,959
planet earth, of course is
Android. In terms of market

33
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,779
share, it's probably a lot
higher in 86% chose that number

34
00:01:45,779 --> 00:01:49,439
because that's just to Android
only if you take other mobile

35
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,529
device platforms such as
postmarket OH S which is pure

36
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,889
Linux as opposed to Android
which is based on Linux and that

37
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:59,429
number probably goes north of
90%. So if you own an Android

38
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:02,189
phone then you benefit from
Linux, every single day. The

39
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,889
next thing Linux is used for and
this is a huge one is cloud

40
00:02:04,889 --> 00:02:07,769
computing. In fact, this very
video that you're watching right

41
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:12,029
now is 100% for sure served to
you by a Linux server somewhere

42
00:02:12,029 --> 00:02:15,149
in the cloud. It's hard to say
exactly what the market share is

43
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:18,719
here is thought to be about 84%
for Linux and just to Google,

44
00:02:18,749 --> 00:02:24,629
Facebook, IBM, and Amazon alone
have around 4 million servers, I

45
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:27,479
have to imagine there's 10s of
millions of servers worldwide

46
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,329
maybe even 100 million and the
vast majority of those are going

47
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:33,149
to be running Linux. But to be
sure this is an area where Linux

48
00:02:33,149 --> 00:02:36,329
is not completely dominant,
there are huge data centers out

49
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:39,569
there running Windows Server
software, and there's several

50
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:42,659
sites that run on Microsoft
technologies. One of the main

51
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:45,959
ones is Stack Exchange, although
I think they only have about 100

52
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,289
servers. Another major area
where Linux is found is IoT

53
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:52,559
devices, and that's whether it's
your ring doorbell on the front

54
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:55,919
of your house, your google home
your Amazon Alexa or the Nest

55
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,589
thermostat on your wall, every
single one of those things are

56
00:02:58,589 --> 00:03:02,249
running Linux, roughly 75% of
all IoT devices are running

57
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,889
Linux, then the remainder are
probably just bare metal

58
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:08,309
operating systems or something
proprietary Linux is a real

59
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:11,189
logical choice for IoT stuff
because it's small and it

60
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:13,859
already has a lot of the tech
stacks available to do common

61
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:16,769
things that you would do in an
IoT device such as maybe

62
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:19,709
Bluetooth or Wi Fi or
interfacing with hardware or

63
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:22,319
otherwise, for a manufacturing
standpoint, who's designing a

64
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,289
new IoT product and they want to
offer it both quick and cheap,

65
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,479
it makes sense to just pick
Linux which already does a lot

66
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,939
of the core stuff they're going
to need. The next place to find

67
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:32,759
Linux to use is as a replacement
for something like Windows or

68
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:36,269
Mac OS, you can use Linux on the
desktop. In fact, right now I'm

69
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:38,789
recording this video on Linux,
and when I'm done recording I'm

70
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:41,759
going to edit it on Linux.
Unfortunately the Linux desktop

71
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,819
market share is embarrassingly
low and that's due to the fact

72
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,519
that it is kind of user
unfriendly although that

73
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,839
improves as each year goes by,
as a Linux enthusiast myself I

74
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:54,509
always hold out hope that this
year will be the year polemics

75
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:57,449
desktop. The next place we'll
find Linux is in self driving

76
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:01,319
cars. And this is true of both
Tesla's as well as the Google

77
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,069
self driving car in the best
drug cases outside of Google and

78
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:09,389
Tesla if a car manufacturer is
making a self driving platform,

79
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:12,779
then they're going to be using
Linux as its base. Did you know

80
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:15,179
you can find Linux on things
like washing machines and

81
00:04:15,179 --> 00:04:18,689
coffeemakers. Well, now you do
that late model Samsung washing

82
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:21,479
machine that you have that lets
you check on your phone to see

83
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:24,239
the stands that are closing
around the world, you can bet

84
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:27,029
that it's running Linux. And
finally, and this one is really

85
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:30,839
cool with the Large Hadron
Collider runs on Linux across

86
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:34,229
it's hundreds of 1000s of cores
and it's 10s if not hundreds of

87
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:38,309
petabytes of collision data,
Linux, indeed did contribute to

88
00:04:38,309 --> 00:04:41,309
the discovery of the Higgs Boson
particle. For those curious I

89
00:04:41,309 --> 00:04:44,609
believe they use the CERN
developed scientific Linux. So

90
00:04:44,609 --> 00:04:47,459
the summary here is that Linux
is prolific and it's used in so

91
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:50,489
many different places for so
many different things, and as

92
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:53,939
the years go by the number of
things continue to increase. If

93
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:55,859
you have any questions about
anything you saw in this video

94
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:58,949
or if you want to share other
places that you know Linux exist

95
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:02,009
or how you use Linux I did it
basis you should let me know in

96
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:05,039
the comments below. Alright that
next video take care.
