# autonotes

Automation tool to autocapture screenshots and join them with a supplied .srt or .txt file and output a notes file in markdown.

**Problem?**

Watching classes / presentations online and taking notes at the same time can be hard sometimes. If they are pre-recorded you can spend a lot of time pausing and unpausing the video. So I wanted to automate the process of taking notes for later reference so I could also just focus on paying uninterrupted attention to the class/presentation.

**Solution**

Tool that takes sceenshots from the classes / presentations (ideally in the right time) and joins them together with a later supplied .srt (or txt but not supported yet) file.
This .srt file can be generated with a number of tools, I'm using otter.ai for converting Speech-to-Text. If you're using this with youtube videos, and the video already has subtitles, you can get that file instead of converting speech to text.

**Note:** This is a WIP, right now you I recommend using [otter.ai](https://otter.ai/) to generate an .srt file from the talk you are listening to and then feed it to this script. You should start recording with otter.ai and autonotes at the same time.

## Example
Both `example_input` and `example_output` folders represent a real use case scenario using the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA-3NI_Lfns
In this scenario, I did the following steps:
1. I had a mobile on the desk with otter.ai open.
2. Started `autonotes` with the command: `mage screen:capture 5 0 5000 jpeg what-is-linux` (it has a start delay of 5s)
3. Started both the video on youtube and otter.ai recording at the same time as the `autonotes` start delay was ending.
4. Exported the .srt file from otter.ai and put it on the `input` folder with the name `what-is-linux.srt`

5. Generate markdown file with the command `mage notes:generate what-is-linux` and the file is save to `output/what-is-linux/what-is-linux.md`

6. Output:

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcos10soares/autonotes.git
cd autonotes
go get -d ./...
```

## Usage

For the sake of simplicity, `mage` was used, there is no need to install it.

If you have mage installed just call `mage` othewise you can do `go run main.go` where you see mage being used.

Just in case you want to install it: [How to Install mage](https://magefile.org/)

Show list of options if you have `mage` installed:
```bash
mage
```
otherwise do:
```bash
go run main.go
```

outputs:
```bash
‚ùØ mage
Mage is a make-like command runner.  See https://magefile.org for full docs.

Targets:
  notes:generate    .md notes file - usage: mage generate <file_and_folder_name_must_have_the_same_name>
  screen:capture    screen - usage: mage screen:capture <start_delay_seconds> <screen_index> <capture_interval_ms> <jpeg_or_png> <output_folder_name>
  screen:test       screen capture all screens and saves them to a "screen_test" folder with the number of the screen
```

### screen test
Tests screen capture on all screens and outputs the images to "output/screen_test".

Use this to find the `index` of the screen you want to capture in case you have multiple monitors.
```bash
mage screen:test
```
or
```bash
go run main.go screen:test
```

### screen capture
Captures screenshots from a monitor, within an interval (if the image is different - overall works well but your usage may vary), and saves them to a folder with a timestamp on the name.

```bash
mage screen:capture <start_delay_seconds> <screen_index> <capture_interval_ms> <jpeg_or_png> <output_folder_name>
```

example usage:
```bash
mage screen:capture 0 0 5000 jpeg my-presentation-notes
```

### generate notes
This assumes that a folder with screenshots was already created (refer to **screen capture** above).

Both the folder and the `.srt` file should have the same name, example folder: `my-presentation-notes` and example .srt file: `my-presentation-notes.srt`.
```bash
mage generate <file_and_folder_name_must_have_the_same_name> <obsidianFormat_true_false>
```

example usage:
```bash
mage generate my-presentation-notes true
```
